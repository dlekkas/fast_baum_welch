## Baum-Welch Algorithm

We are going to implement a fast numerical version of the Baum-Welch algorithm for Hidden Markov Models.
We will start with a straightforward implementation of the algorithm in C++.
Then we will create some test infrastructure to validate our implementation, and a timing infrastructure to measure the performance.
We will continue by applying optimization techniques and we will update README with the techniques we try.
